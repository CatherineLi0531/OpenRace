This project aims to have a clean and extensible design to facilitate community contributions. OpenRace is an open source implementation of the Coderrect Scanner which is a C/C++/Fortran data race detection tool. The open source tool is currently behind the original scanner in terms of feature support, but we are actively developing and expect OpenRace to eventually replace the closed source implementation of Coderrect Scanner. Running# Please note, the tool is still in the early stages of development and does not support many features yet. Until our first release, the easiest way to run the tool is through the coderrect/openrace docker image. > docker pull coderrect/openrace > docker run -it --rm coderrect/openrace # Now we are inside the docker image /OpenRace/examples# make clang-10 -S -emit-llvm -g -fopenmp simplethread.c openrace simplethread.ll ... ==== Races ==== simplethread.c:8:9 simplethread.c:8:9 store i32 %inc, i32* @global, align 4, !dbg !53 %0 = load i32, i32* @global, align 4, !dbg !53 simplethread.c:8:9 simplethread.c:8:9 store i32 %inc, i32* @global, align 4, !dbg !53 store i32 %inc, i32* @global, align 4, !dbg !53 Total Races Detected: 2 Copy The examples directory contains a few sample files and a Makefile to make running the examples easy.

If the \"logical operation\" performed by the features is already implemented, adding support is easy. If not, adding support is slightly more complex. The list of implemented operations can be seen from StmtInfo::Type in IR/IR.h. These are the logical operations currently implented. As an examnple, Fork spawns a new thread and Lock acquires a standard pthread style lock. If the new feature behaves the same as an existing StmtInfo::Type, you only need to add a new recognizer at the IR level. If you need to add a new operation to StmtInfo::Type, you need to write a recognizer and update Trace generation and each of the Analyses. Adding an IRRecognizer# In IR/Builder.cpp the generateRaceFunction traverses LLVM IR and produces a RaceFunction containing only the loigcal operations we care about for race detection. Two things need to be done to add a new recognizer: Add a new Impl class to IR/IRImpls.h Add a new recognizer branch to generateRaceFunction to construct the new Impl class For example, say we want to add pthread_create as a new Fork operation. Defining the Impl class# First, we define a new Impl class in IR/IRImpls.h that implements the ForkInfo interface defined in IR/IR.h. class PthreadCreateInfo : public ForkInfo { constexpr static unsigned int threadHandleOffset = 0; constexpr static unsigned int threadEntryOffset = 2; const llvm::CallBase *inst; public: explicit PthreadCreateInfo(const llvm::CallBase *inst) : inst(inst) {} [[nodiscard]] inline const llvm::CallBase *getInst() const override { return inst; } [[nodiscard]] const llvm::Value *getThreadHandle() const override { return inst->getArgOperand(threadHandleOffset)->stripPointerCasts(); } [[nodiscard]] const llvm::Value *getThreadEntry() const override { return inst->getArgOperand(threadEntryOffset)->stripPointerCasts(); } }; Copy Adding a branch to generateRaceFunction# Second, we add a branch to generateRaceFunction that recognizes a call to pthread_create, constructs the new impl class, and adds the constructed object to the list of instructions. if (isPthreadCreate(funcName)) { instructions.push_back(std::make_shared<PthreadCreateInfo>(callInst)); Copy Testing# Anytime anything new is added, you should add a new test case where appropriate. Writing Tests# Tests are written using Catch2. All tests and test related data are stored under the tests/ folder. All test files are named like <topic>.test.cpp where topic is the thing being tested. The tests themselves are then split into categories by subfolder. There are two main categories: unit and integration. The data folder contains input files that are consumed by some of the tests. Unit tests cover the functionality of a specific component, such as PointerAnalysis or Trace construction. Because unit tests correspond directly to components in the code, the structure of the unit test folder closely matches the structure of the src folder. Integration tests are testing the tool as a whole. Most of the integration tests read in some benchmark file, generate a race report, and then check that the race report matches what is expected. If you need to read some data from a file in a test, assume the working directory to be tests/data. This is the working directory used when CMake runs the test binary. Running Tests# The easiest way to run the tests is to run ctest in the build directory after building the project. The test binary is build/bin/tester. If running the binary directly, the working directory should be set to tests/data so that tests can find their input files. This configuration has been set up already and can be done automatically by running ctest directly.

Meanwhile, we also welcome all pull requests to help refine our existing docs. This documentation describes everything about contributing to OpenRace documentation. Documentation overview# The documentation site for Coderrect OpenRace is generated using Docusaurus and hosted on GitHub Page. All configurations, resources, and source code are placed under OpenRace/website (here). The structure of the website folder is as follows: docs/ contains all documentations written in markdown. src/ contains custom pages and css files. static/ contains all resources such as images. docusaurus.config.js is the configuration file for Docusaurus. sidebars.js is the file defining the sidebar structure. Once anything under OpenRace/website is updated, a GitHub Action will be triggered to deploy the newest doc pages to branch gh-pages as GitHub Pages. The script for building and deploying doc pages is under OpenRace/.github/workflow/docs.yaml. Adding new doc pages# Adding new doc pages is as simple as writing some markdown files. You can simply create or modify markdown files under the docs/ folder. For each markdown file, you need to at least add the followings at the top: --- id: doc-contribute-to-docs title: Contribute to Docs --- Copy where you specify the id of this doc file and its title. The doc file id is used for referring to this doc file at other places (e.g. sidebar). Referring other docs# To refer to another doc page, you can simply use the syntax below: [link-name](relative/path/to/doc.md) Copy For example, suppose this doc page is placed under the same directory as the \"Get Started with Coderrect OpenRace\" page (doc-get-started.md), the code below will be rendered as: This is a [link](doc-get-started.md) to the \"Get Started\" doc page. Copy This is a link to the \"Get Started\" doc page. Including images# Images are preferred to help explain things better. To include images, we should put your images under website/static/img/. Then you can use markdown syntax or HTML to include images in your documentation.

The table below gives a high level overview of the status on some key features, and detailed descriptions on partially and not supported features are given below. Feature Support Feature Support omp for loops full threadprivate full barrier full sections full master full offloading partial single full tasks partial reduction full simd none atomic full ordered none critical full depend none Remaining OpenMP Features# These are features that are not fully supported in OpenRace. Offloaded OpenMP# OpenRace has partial support for offloaded OpenMP. Offloaded regions are treated mostly the same as regular OpenMP code, whith a few exceptions. When offloaded to a GPU, some OpenMP synchronization features cannot prevent data races to shared memory. These synchronizations are ignored in offloaded regions. Otherwise, the analysis of offloaded regions is treated the same as normal OpenMP parallel regions. OpenMP tasks# Only the simplest use cases of task is supported so far. Task creation and task completion either through barriers or taskwait have been modeled. Complex usage (e.g. using taskwait or barriers to synchronize groups of nested tasks) is not supported yet. OpenMP tasks also include a number of related features like taskloops, taskgroup, task depend which have yet to be supported in OpenRace. The tool may report false positives in cases where complex synchronizations with tasks are used, and false negatives when unsupported task related features are used. SIMD# The simd directive can be used on its own or in combination with some specific OpenMP features (e.g. parallel for simd, taskloop simd, and more). Any usage of simd is not supported by OpenRace. Any races present in SIMD code will likely be missed. Ordered/Depend# The depend clause can be copmbined with various OpenMP features to describe a ordering between different tasks. OpenRace has no support for depend and the described orderings will not be modeled by the tool. This will likely lead to false positives in code that uses the depend clause. Array Index Analysis# Array Index Analysis is used to determine if any array accesses within a parallel loop may overlap OpenRace currently uses an intra-procedural array index analysis based on LLVM's Scalar Evolution. The main limitation of the current implementation is the inability to detect races across function calls. The classic example of a race in a parallel loop is shown below. #define N = 100; int A[N]; #pragma omp parallel for for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { A[i] = A[i+1]; } Copy The array index analysis used by OpenRace can detect this race, as all array accesses are made directly inside the parallel loop. However, if same code is rewritten such that the accesses happen within a function call, OpenRace's array index analysis is unable to detect the race. int read (int *array, int idx) { return array[idx]; } int write(int *array, int idx, int val) { return array[idx] = val; } // ... #pragma omp parallel for for (int i = 0; i < N: i++) { int val = read(A, i+1); write(A, i, val); } Copy Edit this page Previous « Get Started with Coderrect OpenRace Next Setting Up Dev Environment » OpenMP Support Summary Remaining OpenMP Features Offloaded OpenMP OpenMP tasks SIMD Ordered/Depend Array Index Analysis","s":"OpenMP Support","u":"/OpenRace/doc-openmp-support","h":"","p":12},{"i":15,"t":"Design Overview The description of this program is split into two parts. The Flow of Execution describes how the input is processed step by step to produce an output, following the logical flow of the program. The Project Layout describes the project by its physical layout, through short summaries for each subdirectory in the src folder. Flow of Execution# The logical entry point for the race detection functionality is in src/RaceDetect/RaceDetect.h. This function takes an LLVM IR module as input, and produces a race report as output. The intermediate steps to produce the race report are: Construct a static program trace Preprocessing Pointer Analysis Race IR Run analyses Combine analyses to do race detection Generate report Program Trace# First a ProgramTrace is constructed from the input IR. This trace represents a simulated execution of the program. During the construction of the program trace, a number of things happen. PreProcessing transformations are run to make analyses easier a whole program PointerAnalysis is run on the llvm module the LLVM IR is converted to a higher level IR for easier analysis See the Trace section for more detail on how the ProgramTrace is built. Analysis# Next a number of analyses are run. Each takes the program trace as input and can then be queried for some property in the program trace. The core analyses are: SharedMemory analysis finds events that could potentially access the same location in memory. HappensBefore analysis determines if two events could potentially happen in parallel. LockSet tracks what locks are held by an event during execution, and can be used to find if two events share a common lock. See the Analysis section for more details. Race Detection# After constructing the program trace and analyses, the detectRaces function combines everything to detect any races. A simple race detection algorithm could combine the core analyses like so: ProgramTrace program; SharedMemory sharedmem(program); HappensBeforeGraph happensbefore(program); LockSet lockset(program); for (auto sharedAccessPair : sharedmem) { if (happensbefore.areParallel(sharedAccessPair) && !lockset.shareLock(sharedAccessPair)) { // report race! } } Copy See the RaceDetect section. Generate Report# Finally, a report needs to be generated so that any detected races can be displayed to the user or reported to some tool. See the Reporter section. Project Layout# This section describes code by each subdirectory in src. To get an idea of the flow of execution through the program, see the Logical Overview above. The most important directories are: IR for converting the input into a format we can analyze PointerAnalysis for our custom pointer analysis implementation LanguageModel for how language features are recognized Trace for generating a program Trace Analysis for our different analyses The top level src directory also contains the main race detection logic in RaceDetect.h/cpp, and main.cpp which is the entry point to the racedetect executable. Analysis# This directory contains all of our different analyses. Each of them takes a program trace as input and then allows for some specific property of the program trace to be queried. Each of the analyses is constructed using the ProgramTrace to be analyzed, and then queried for specific data. ProgramTrace program; ... // Construct from program trace HappensBeforeGraph hpg(program); ... // Query to see if the events can be run in parallel hpg.areParallel(event1, event2); Copy Demangler# This directory contains some common code for demangling C++ function names. IR# This folder contains interfaces describing logical operations (IR.h), implementations of those interfaces (IRImpls.h), and a function that takes an LLVM Function and constructs a list of logical operations (Builder.h). In the context of race detection, most of the LLVM IR instructions are not needed. Given an LLVM IR function that looks like this %.global_tid..addr = alloca i32* %.bound_tid..addr = alloca i32* %count.addr = alloca i32* store i32* %.global_tid., i32** %.global_tid..addr call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata i32** %.global_tid..addr, metadata !23, metadata !DIExpression()) store i32* %.bound_tid., i32** %.bound_tid..addr call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata i32** %.bound_tid..addr, metadata !25, metadata !DIExpression()) store i32* %count, i32** %count.addr call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata i32** %count.addr, metadata !26, metadata !DIExpression()) %0 = load i32*, i32** %count.addr %1 = load i32, i32* %0, align 4 %inc = add nsw i32 %1, 1 store i32 %inc, i32* %0, align 4 ret void Copy Race detection only really needs to know the following write i32** %.global_tid..addr write i32** %.bound_tid..addr write i32** %count.addr read i32** %count.addr read %0 write %0 Copy So the code in the IR directory focuses on extracting only the LLVM instructions needed for race detection, and wrapping them in a common set of interfaces (read, write, fork, join) that can be consumed more easily by later analyses. The logical operation interfaces are wrappers around LLVM Instructions, and return values in terms of LLVM IR. Logical operations will later be converted to program events, which answer questions in terms of static program execution. As an example, in the context of race detection the only information we really need to know about a read operation, is what value is being read. So, the interface for a logical read operation looks something like the following. class Read { public: virtual const llvm::Inst* getInst() const = 0; virtual const llvm::Value *getReadValue() const = 0; }; Copy Many instructions can act as logical reads. A vector access, some external functions call, or just the LLVM IR load instruction. Now to treat different types of llvm instructions as reads, we just need to define a derived class implementing the read interface. class Load : public Read { const LoadInst *load; public: const llvm::LoadInst* getInst() const override { return load; } const llvm::Value *getReadValue() const override { return load->getPointerOperand(); } }; class MemCpyRead : public Read { const CallBase *inst; public: const llvm::LoaCallBasedInst* getInst() const override { return inst; } // Assuming 3rd operand is the value being read. This is a fake example const llvm::Value *getReadValue() const override { return load->getOperand(3); } }; Copy Lastly, the Builder file contains functions to recognize and construct these concrete implementations from LLVM IR. There is a loop that looks something like // Note: not real code llvm::Function input; LogicalOperations output; for (auto instruction : input.instruction()) { if (isLoad(instruction)) { auto read = Load(instruction); output.push_back(read) } else if (isMemCpy(instruction)) { auto read = MemCpyRead(instruction); output.push_back(read) } ... } Copy Each branch in the loop call a \"recognizer\" function defined in the LanguageModel directory. When a match is found, the corresponding concrete impl is constructed and added to the list of logical operations. LanguageModel# The LanguageModel directory contains code related to recognizing certain language or framework features in LLVM IR. Most of the files in this directory recognize specific API calls. For example, pthread.h contains a list of \"recognizers\". // pthread.h ... bool isPthreadCreate(llvm::StringRef name); bool isPthreadJoin(llvm::StringRef name); ... Copy These recognizers are used to determine if the function being called is a certain API call (e..g. pthread create or join). The majority of the code in LanguageModel are recognizers like this for various libraries or frameworks. The only exceptions are the RaceModel.* files. RaceModel# RaceModel tells PointerAnalysis how to interpret certain function calls. Given this example void *entry(void *arg) {...} ... pthread_create(t, NULL, entry, &val); Copy Pointer analysis needs to know that the call to pthread_create will cause the entry function to be executed, and that the arg passed to the entry function points to the memory location of val. The RaceModel class is used to extend PointerAnalysis with the information necessary to build a correct call graph and link function arguments. The two functions that control this are: interceptFunction which decides how each function is expanded in the call graph interceptCallSite which links the pointer from the call site to the called function As any example, to tell Pointer Analysis that a call to pthread_create(t, NULL, entry, &val) should result in the entry function being visited next in the call graph, interceptFunction can be modified to include the following code. InterceptResult RaceModel::interceptFunction(const ctx *callerCtx, const ctx *calleeCtx, const llvm::Function *F, const llvm::Instruction *callsite) { auto funcName = F->getName(); ... if (PthreadModel::isPthreadCreate(funcName)) { race::PthreadCreateIR create(llvm::cast<CallBase>(callsite)); auto callback = create.getThreadEntry()->stripPointerCasts(); return {callback, InterceptResult::Option::EXPAND_BODY}; } ... Copy To also link the pointer passed to the entry function (e.g. link&val to void *arg), the interceptCallSite can be updated accordingly. bool RaceModel::interceptCallSite(const CtxFunction<ctx> *caller, const CtxFunction<ctx> *callee, const llvm::Function *originalTarget, const llvm::Instruction *callsite) { ... auto const funcName = call->getCalledFunction()->getName(); if (PthreadModel::isPthreadCreate(funcName)) { // pthread_create passes a single void* as 4th arg // pthread_create(null, foo, null, &val) // foo(void *arg) // link 4th arg of caller to 1st arg of callee PtrNode *formal = this->getPtrNode(callee->getContext(), &*callee->getFunction()->arg_begin()); PtrNode *actual = this->getPtrNode(caller->getContext(), call->getArgOperand(3)); this->consGraph->addConstraints(actual, formal, Constraints::copy); return true; } ... Copy Logging# This directory contains the code used throughout the project for logging. PointerAnalysis# This documentation is still in progress. PreProcessing# This directory contains a number of passes and transformations that make the LLVM IR easier for our tool to analyze. Reporter# This directory contains the code responsible for collecting detected races and formatting them into some output. Eventually this directory should contain logic for reporting races in a JSON format, but the reporter is still under development. Trace# Trace contains the logic for simulating execution and creating a static program trace. The important code in this directory are Event, ThreadTrace, and ProgramTrace. The Event contains a list of interfaces, similar to the IR.h file (see the IR section). Each Event interface wraps an IR type. Where IR interfaces return values in the context of LLVM IR, events return values in the context of the simulated execution. As an example, look at the following interface for a read at IR and Event levels. class ReadIR { public: virtual const llvm::Value *getReadValue() const = 0; }; class ReadEvent { public: virtual list<AbstractObj> *getReadMemory() const = 0; }; Copy The ReadIR interface returns the llvm::Value being accessed, but the Event interface returns a list of abstract locations in memory that could potentially be accessed. This is the key difference between IR and Events. IR interfaces are just wrappers around LLVM IR instructions, but Events represent actual program events and their simulated execution. Lastly, to construct a list of simulated events (e.g. a trace), a function in ThreadTrace takes an entry function as input, traverses the Race IR and builds the simulated trace for a given thread. The ProgramTrace class is just a collection of thread traces representing all threads that ran during simulated program execution.

It implements a context-sensitive and field-sensitive inclusion-based (Andersen) Pointer Analysis algorithm. High-Level Architecture# There are three major components in the pointer analysis framework and they interact with each other to compute the final result. These components communicated with each other through a set of pre-defined APIs in MemModelTrait as well as in LangModelTrait. At high level, Language Model abstracts the target program into the constraint graph, the pointer analysis framework offers the flexibility for user-defined language model to intercept any function call in the program and handle it differently; Memory Model handles the creation of the static objects, different memory models handles object creation differently. E.g., Field-Insensitive Memory Model (FIMemModel.h) simply creates one object node for the object while Field-Sensitive Memory Model (FSMemModel.h) creates one object node for each field of the object. Finally, Solver takes the constraint graph as the input and computes the final result. Detailed Implementation# Language Model: Language Model transfers the program into the constraint graph/pointer assignment graph.It creates pointer nodes (corresponding pointers in the program) and links nodes with different kinds of edges (corresponding to different operations performed in the program). There are five different kinds of edges in the constraint graph. enum class Constraints : std::uint8_t { load, store, copy, addr_of, offset, }; Copy load edge: if ptr1 = *ptr2;, then ptr2 --load--> ptr1 (ptr2 is loaded into ptr1). store edge: if *ptr1 = ptr2;, then ptr2 --store--> ptr1 (ptr2 is stored into ptr1). copy edge: if ptr1 = ptr2;, then ptr2 --copy--> ptr1 (ptr2 is copied to ptr1). addr_of edge: if ptr1 = &ptr2; , then ptr2--addr_of--> ptr1 (ptr1 takes the address of ptr2) offset edge: if ptr1 = ptr2->f;, then ptr2--offset-->ptr1 (ptr1 add a offset to ptr2). Memory Model: Memory Model models the objects allocated in the program. For example, it computes the size of each object, the memory layout of each object and it creates object nodes in the Constraint Graph.Currently, we have two different memory models: Field-insensitive memory model: Field-insensitive memory model is a simple implementation of the memory model. It is relatively fast but also inaccurate. The field-insensitive memory model does not distinguish different fields of the object. For the following code snippet: struct A { int a, int b, } obj; int *ptr1 = &obj.a; int *ptr2 = &obj.b; // ptr1 and ptr2 are considered as alias when using field-insensitive memory // model, even though they point to different fields of the object. ALIAS(ptr1, ptr2) == true Copy Field-sensitive memory model: Field-sensitive memory model (still in process) overcomes the limitations of the field-insensitive memory model. It distinguishes different fields of the same object so that the ptr1 and ptr2 in the above example are not considered as aliases. It computes the memory layout (the offset of each field) and provides APIs to index into the complicated object to access the right fields. Andersen Solver: After the language model builds the constraint graph and memory model models the object, the pointer analysis uses the solver to computes the points-to set of the pointer. The detailed description of the algorithm can be found via http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/fernando/publications/papers/CGO09.pdf. Field-Sensitivity# Since the implementation of Field Sensitivity is complex, We provide some additional information in the documentation. Field-sensitive pointer analysis is achieved by handling the offset constraints in the above table, at a high level, the constraint v <- &s.field is satisfied by first index the object s.field and then add the address of s.field to the pts(v). SolverBase.h: processOffset implements the functionality. For efficiency, the processOffset function maintains a cache (handledGEPMap) for GEP instructions to only handled diffed object indexing that haven’t been handled before. The diffed object indexing is implementation as below: PtsTy &handled = handledGEPMap.try_emplace(ptrNode).first->second; const PtsTy &curPts = PT::getPointsTo(src->getNodeID()); PtsTy newGEPs; newGEPs.intersectWithComplement(curPts, handled); // set intersect with complement Copy After the diffed points-to set is computed, it iterate over the set using the following loop. for (auto objNode : nodeVec) { // this might create new object, thus modify the points-to set auto *fieldObj = llvm::cast_or_null<ObjNodeTy>(LMT::indexObject(this->getLangModel(), objNode, gep)); if (fieldObj == nullptr) { continue; } if (!PT::has(ptrNode->getNodeID(), fieldObj->getObjectID())) { this->consGraph->addConstraints(fieldObj, ptrNode, Constraints::addr_of); callBack(fieldObj, ptrNode); changed = true; } } Copy The fieldObject is computed by statement LMT::indexObject(this->getLangModel(), objNode, gep) which index the object. The indexObject method is implemented differently when using different memory model, in FSMemModel, the code is available in FSMemModel::indexObject() We implemented a different scheme than the traditional field-sensitive pointer analysis for C/C++ which uses logic field index to index the object. Our implementation instead uses physical layout offset to index objects. At a high level, FSMemModel computes a MemLayout for different types. For example, suppose sizeof(double *) == 4, the memory layout for the following structure is a bitvector and is computed as below: struct inner { double *b; double *c; }; struct outter { struct inner array_inner[10]; double* d; }; Copy // memory layout |1000 1000| 1000 |--array--| // mark the first 8 bytes (corresponding to array_inner) as array Copy FSMemModel::indexObject() method indices the memory layout to test whether the bit is set in the memory layout and return the corresponding object at the offset as following auto offset = llvm::APInt(DL.getIndexTypeSizeInBits(gep->getType()), 0); gep->accumulateConstantOffset(DL, offset); auto result = obj->memBlock->getObjectAt(obj->pOffset + offset.getSExtValue()); Copy It first use accumulate the offset of the gep by gep->accumulateConstantOffset(DL, offset) and then it index the object using auto result = obj->memBlock->getObjectAt(obj->pOffset + offset.getSExtValue()). If the supplied physical offset is invalid (can not be indexed), it returns nullptr. Heuristics# Will update whenever heuristics are discovered. We explain our heuristic code in our pointer analysis in this section. Some heuristic decisions are removed, some are left to users to specify the desired values, and others are reserved in our code base. User-Specified Heuristics# INDIRECT_OPTION: Whether and how to add the resolved indirect function calls to the callgraph There are three options: enum class IndirectResolveOption { SKIP, // Do not add the resolved function to the callgraph WITH_LIMIT, // Only add the resolved function to the callgraph iff the indirect call limit is not exceeded. CRITICAL, // Make sure the function are inserted to callgraph, even if the limit has been exceeded. }; Copy For the usage of WITH_LIMIT, the limit is defined by variable Max_Indirect_Target. Default value: INDIRECT_OPTION = IndirectResolveOption::WITH_LIMIT and Max_Indirect_Target = 999 Specified by user since commit 5c766da289c3b8cc1ba2df56ab8b0207a4bfc74e How to specify: for example, if choosing SKIP: openrace -INDIRECT_OPTION=SKIP pthread-simple.ll Copy if choosing 'WITH_LIMIT': openrace -INDIRECT_OPTION=WITH_LIMIT -Max_Indirect_Target=1028 pthread-simple.ll Copy ANON_REC_LIMIT: Set the upperbound of the total size of recursively-created anonymous objects in a program Default value: 999 Specified by user since commit cf77af58709374a7ff5d8237bc0f9361d4b270e0 How to specify: for example, openrace -ANON_REC_LIMIT=10 pthread-simple.ll Copy ANON_REC_DEPTH_LIMIT: Set the upperbound of the depth of types considered for a recursively-created anonymous object in a program Default value: 10 Specified by user since commit cf77af58709374a7ff5d8237bc0f9361d4b270e0 How to specify: for example, openrace -ANON_REC_DEPTH_LIMIT=5 pthread-simple.ll Copy Reserved Heuristics# HASH_EDGE_LIMIT: Define the size of requiredEdges (of type llvm::BitVector) which indexes the newly added copy edges by using the hash values of the two nodes involved in a copy edge. The maximum value of the hash value is 4,294,967,295 (as indicated by size_t, a.k.a., unsigned long int). As shown here, in order to save memory and improve performance, and also the size of newly added copy edges is limited for every iteration, we use HASH_EDGE_LIMIT as the size for requiredEdges instead of the max value. Default value: 1000032953 The array heap allocation types might be inferred using heuristics The assumption here is: if the last element of the allocated structure is a zero-sized array, it is a structure type with flexible array element.

We test all of our builds using Ubuntu 20.04, though any recent linux based OS should work. This guide will give instructions based on Ubuntu 20.04. To follow this guide on setting up a dev environment you will need: A modern C++ compiler (gcc/clang) Ninja Build Conan LLVM 10.0.1 Install Compiler# Most systems should already have gcc installed, but just in case, these commands can be used to install gcc. # Update packages sudo apt update # Install gcc and ninja sudo apt install -y build-essential ninja-build # Check that gcc is installed gcc --version Copy Install Conan# Conan is used to automatically manage OpenRace's dependencies (except for LLVM). Here are two ways to install Conan. The easiest way is through python and pip if you already have them installed: # Python2 pip install conan # Python3 pip3 install conan Copy Alternatively, you can also obtain the package binary and install Conan from there: # Download curl -L -O https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/latest/download/conan-ubuntu-64.deb # Install dpkg -i conan-ubuntu-64.deb Copy For more information or examples on installing Conan, see their installation instructions. Install LLVM 10.0.1# LLVM will need to be built from source. # Get the source code git clone --depth 1 -b llvmorg-10.0.1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git mkdir -p llvm-project/build && cd llvm-project/build # Configure the build with CMake cmake \\ -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=\"X86\" \\ -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=\"17\" \\ -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF \\ -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \\ -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF \\ -DLLVM_APPEND_VC_REV=OFF \\ -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=ON \\ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install \\ -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='clang;openmp' \\ -G Ninja \\ ../llvm # Build and Install cmake --build . --parallel cmake --build . --target install # Save directory LLVM 10.0.1 was installed to export LLVM_INSTALL=$(pwd)/install/ # if using a custom install prefix, set LLVM_INSTALL to ${prefix}/ Copy There are a lot of CMake options to customize the LLVM build. See LLVM's page on CMake for more options. The important ones used above are: LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=\"X86\"We only build for the X86 platform to save time CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=\"17\"OpenRace is also using C++17 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ReleaseBuilds LLVM in Release mode; use Debug instead to make debugging easier LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='clang;openmp'Builds clang-10.0.1 and OpenMP together with LLVM; they are required for building test cases -G NinjaBuilding using Ninja Build The rest are just some options set to save time/space when building. The location LLVM 10.0.1 was installed to will be needed to build OpenRace. In this guide we saved the install location to an environment variable named LLVM_INSTALL. Building OpenRace# As a backup, you may also build from the shell using the following: # Get the source code git clone https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace.git mkdir OpenRace/build && cd OpenRace/build # Configure build with cmake cmake \\ -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \\ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \\ -DLLVM_INSTALL=$LLVM_INSTALL \\ -DENABLE_WARNING=ON \\ -G Ninja \\ .. # Build OpenRace cmake --build . --parallel # Check that OpenRace was built ./bin/openrace --help Copy The cmake options do the following: CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ONProduces a compile_commands.json file in the build directory. Most IDEs can be set up to use this file for neat IDE features. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DebugBuilds the project in debug mode. This makes it is easier to debug if/when issues occur. LLVM_INSTALL=$LLVM_INSTALLShould point to a directory that LLVM was installed to. See the \"Install LLVM 10.0.1\" section above. ENABLE_WARNING=ONEnable compiler warnings while building the project. The enabled warnings can be found here. Running Tests# From the build directory, run ctest. This should automatically handle running tests from the correct directory. OpenRace/build> ctest ... 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 25 Total Test time (real) = 29.24 sec Copy Tests can also be executed manually using thebin/tester executable. Many of the tests read IR files and are expected to be run from the /tests/data directory. Keep this in mind if running tests manually. OpenRace/tests/data> ../../build/bin/tester ... 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 25 Total Test time (real) = 29.24 sec Copy We use Catch2 for testing. See their documentation for more options on running their tests. It is expected that all tests will always pass in the main branch of the project. Using clang-format# All code should be formatted according to the .clang-format file at the project root. Coderrect OpenRace adopts Google's C++ Style Guide with some small customizations. Most IDEs can be set to run clang-format automatically. Check the settings for your IDE on how to set this up. Worst case, clang format can be run manually on an individual file clang-format -i -style=file file.cpp Copy Or on the entire project directory (careful to run this from within this project's directory as it will recursively overwrite all files ending in .h or .cpp in this directory and all subdirectories). cd OpenRace/ find . -iname *.h -o -iname *.cpp | xargs clang-format -i -style=file Copy VSCode# VSCode can be configured to automatically run clang format each time a file is saved if the C/C++ extension installed. In VSCode's preferences/settings, make sure the following two are set: Text Editor -> Formatting -> Format on Save (should be checked) Extensions -> C/C++ -> clang_format_path (needs to be set to the path of clang format) This should ensure clang format is run automatically each time a file is saved.
